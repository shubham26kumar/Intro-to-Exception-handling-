    "Ans :- An exception is an error which happens at the time of execution of a program. However, while running a program, Python generates an exception that should be handled to avoid your program to crash. In Python language, exceptions trigger automatically on errors, or they can be triggered and intercepted by your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception indicates that, although the event can occur, this type of event happens infrequently. When the method is not able to handle the exception, it is thrown to its caller function. Eventually, when an exception is thrown out of the main function, the program is terminated abruptly.\n",
    "Common Examples of Exception:\n",
    "Division by Zero\n",
    "Accessing a file which does not exist.\n",
    "Addition of two incompatible types\n",
    "Trying to access a nonexistent index of a sequence\n",
    "Removing the table from the disconnected database server.\n",
    "ATM withdrawal of more than the available amount\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error occurs when the structure of a program does not conform to the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter when the program is being compiled or executed, and they prevent the program from running. Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes in the source code, such as typos, omissions, or incorrect use of syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are usually caused by runtime errors, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an element in an array with an out-of-bounds index, or trying to access a file that does not exist. Exceptions are not syntax errors, but they can still prevent the program from running if they are not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks. When an exception is thrown, the program will try to execute the code in the catch block, which can handle the exception and allow the program to continue running. If the exception is not caught, the program will terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a syntax error is a mistake in the structure of the program that prevents it from running, while an exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of the program and can be handled to allow the program to continue running."

    "Ans:-The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes code following the try statement as a “normal” part of the program.

    "Ans:\"- Python has many built-in exceptions with it, apart from these built-in list python has the capability to provide custom exceptions to the users. These custom exceptions are named as user-defined exceptions. Here the user-defined exceptions can be built defined by using a class declared for it. These customer exceptions are declared specifically to satisfy user necessities. All the user-defined exceptions will be derived from the user class.\n",

    "\n",
    "A user-defined exception handling process needs to have a user-defined class representing the exception to be created.

    "While writing real-life programs for various applications, we must put constraints on the variables of use. For instance, in Date-of-birth, a month cannot be greater than 12 nor be negative, or the social media username must not contain a space character. To handle these sensitive values and to force them to be of a specific format, we use user-defined exceptions in Python. These user-defined exceptions can be derived from the superclass of Exception(Multiple Inheritance), used as a normal Python class, or implemented using Standard Exceptions such as Runtime Exception.Sometimes we must enforce constraints on the values that specific program variables can take or save the program from running into an undesired state. In such situations, Python allows programmers to create User-defined Exceptions. To create a User-defined Exception, we need to create a class directly or indirectly derived from the built-in Exception class.\n",
